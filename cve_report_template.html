<tr><td>crypto-js</td><td>4.0.0</td><td>CVE-2023-46233</td><td>9.1</td><td class=warning>CRITICAL</td><td>crypto-js is a JavaScript library of crypto standards. Prior to version 4.2.0, crypto-js PBKDF2 is 1,000 times weaker than originally specified in 1993, and at least 1,300,000 times weaker than current industry standard. This is because it both defaults to SHA1, a cryptographic hash algorithm considered insecure since at least 2005, and defaults to one single iteration, a 'strength' or 'difficulty' value specified at 1,000 when specified in 1993. PBKDF2 relies on iteration count as a countermeasure to preimage and collision attacks. If used to protect passwords, the impact is high. If used to generate signatures, the impact is high. Version 4.2.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, configure crypto-js to use SHA256 with at least 250,000 iterations.</td><td></td></tr>

<tr><td>xml2js</td><td>0.4.23</td><td>CVE-2023-0842</td><td>5.3</td><td class=warning>MEDIUM</td><td>xml2js version 0.4.23 allows an external attacker to edit or add new properties to an object. This is possible because the application does not properly validate incoming JSON keys, thus allowing the __proto__ property to be edited.</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>events</td><td>3.1.0</td><td>CVE-2018-25076</td><td>9.8</td><td class=warning>CRITICAL</td><td>A vulnerability classified as critical was found in Events Extension on BigTree. Affected by this vulnerability is the function getRandomFeaturedEventByDate/getUpcomingFeaturedEventsInCategoriesWithSubcategories/recacheEvent/searchResults of the file classes/events.php.
